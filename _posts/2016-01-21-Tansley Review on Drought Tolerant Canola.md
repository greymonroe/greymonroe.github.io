# [Molecular and systems approaches towards drought-tolerant canola crops](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.13866/full)

How can we combine -omics tools and natural variation in Arabidopsis and Brassica to increase drought tolerance in canola?

*Discoveries in Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica -omics tools, and natural variation in Brassica species provide complementary and synergistic research approaches. When combined, these tools can identify the genetic basis for stress response traits that may yield advances in efforts to improve canola drought tolerance by transgenic and breeding strategies.*
