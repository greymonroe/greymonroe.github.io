    title: "Evolution of drought tolerance along drought frequency gradient"
    excerpt: "Droughts affect millions of people each year and impose strong natural selection. In the [lab of John Mckay](http://www.mckaylab.colostate.edu/) at Colorado State, I study the evolution of drought tolerance traits and genes along a remotely sensed historic drought frequency gradient in *Arabidopsis thaliana*."

    title: "Understanding responses to water availability using function-valued-traits"
    excerpt: "Function-valued-traits treat phenotypes as mathematical functions related to development or environment. With [Dave Des Marais](https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/people/david-des-marais/) at Harvard University, I am applying a function-valued-trait apporoach to understand genetic and interspecific variation in responses to a continuous water availability gradient in *Brachypodium*.

    title: "Genetics and physiology drought response in rice"
    excerpt: "Working with [Amelia Henry](http://irri.org/about-us/our-people/specialists/amelia-henry) at the International Rice Research Institute to dissect the genetic and physiological basis of drought response among diverse varieties of rice."
